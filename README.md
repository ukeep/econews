Clip your newspaper in Google Drive. Serve it to the web.

Newsclip is a web app to display news stories catalogued in a Google spreadsheet and saved as images in Google Drive.

*Workflow*
 1. Scan or screenshot newspaper stories and save as images in Google Drive.
 2. Catalogue them in a Google spreadsheet. Tag with topics and people of interest. Add online links.
 3. Make a mail digest to send to subscribers with a single copy/paste of HTML code from spreadsheet to Mailchimp.
 4. Run a Google App Script to export your updates from spreadsheet to JSON.
 5. Users can now access your complete news archive with the intuitive web app.

*Web app features*
